            <p>The 2023–24 season is Real Madrid Club de Fútbol's 120th season in existence and the club's 93rd consecutive season in the top flight of Spanish football. In addition to the domestic league, Real Madrid is participating in this season's editions of the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League. As the reigning champions of the Spanish Cup, Madrid also participated in the Supercopa de España, beating Barcelona 4–1 in the final to win their 13th title in the competition.

                This season is for the very first time since 2008–09 to not feature Karim Benzema, who departed to Saudi Arabian club Al-Ittihad, and the first since 2015–16 without Marco Asensio, who left Los Merengues to join French side Paris Saint-Germain.</p>
